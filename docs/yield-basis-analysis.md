# Yield Basis vs EulerSwap Analysis

Comparison of the Yield Basis approach (Egorov, June 2025) with EulerSwap's architecture, assessing whether EulerSwap can replicate IL elimination.

## Yield Basis: Core Mechanism

**Paper**: "Eliminating impermanent loss by leveraged liquidity" — Michael Egorov, 12 June 2025

### The Problem

A standard constant-product AMM LP position has value proportional to `√p`. When price moves from `p₀` to `p₁`, the LP suffers impermanent loss:

```
IL = 2√(p₁/p₀) / (1 + p₁/p₀) − 1
```

This is always negative — LPs lose relative to holding.

### The Solution: Compounding Leverage

With compounding leverage `L`, position value scales as `(Vc)^L`:

```
V* = (Vc / Vc₀)^L × V₀
```

For a constant-product LP, `Vc ∝ √p`. At `L = 2`:

```
V* ∝ (√p)² = p
```

The `√p` drag vanishes — position value tracks the underlying asset linearly. IL is eliminated.

### Releverage AMM

Yield Basis maintains `L = 2` dynamically via a "releverage AMM" with invariant:

```
(x₀(pₒ) − d) · y = I(pₒ)
```

where `x₀(pₒ)` is recomputed on every trade via quadratic (Eq. 20 in the paper):

```
x₀ = [B + √(B² + 4AC)] / (2A)

A = 1 − f
B = (2L−1)·D − p·y₀ − (1−f)·x₀_old
C = p·y₀·x₀_old
```

Key properties:
- `x₀` adjusts with oracle price `pₒ`, maintaining target leverage
- Position value: `V = x₀ / (2L − 1)` (Eq. 21)
- Uses flash loans for deposits/withdrawals and rebalancing
- Admin fee: `fa = 1 − (1−fmin)·√(1 − s/T)` where `s` = time since last trade (Eq. 24)
- Virtual pool arbitrage via flash loan amount `φ` from quadratic (Eq. 39–41)

### Simulation Results

From the paper's backtests:
- BTC/USD: ~20% APR over 6 years (2019–2025)
- ETH/USD: similar performance profile
- Fee income consistently outpaces the (now-eliminated) IL

## EulerSwap: Architecture Summary

### Static Boost Model

EulerSwap computes virtual reserves once at position creation:

```
x₀ = xr × bXC × bXL
```

- `bXC = sX / (sX − 1)` — concentration boost from narrowing price range
- `bXL` — leverage boost, calibrated for `H = 1` at the range boundary

The boost is **fixed** — it does not change as price moves.

### AMM Curves

```
fX(x) = y₀ + (px/py)(x₀−x)(cx + (1−cx)(x₀/x))    for x ∈ (0, x₀]
gY(y) = x₀ + (py/px)(y₀−y)(cy + (1−cy)(y₀/y))    for y ∈ (0, y₀]
```

The concentration parameter `cx ∈ [0, 1)` interpolates between:
- `cx = 0`: constant-product (`xy = k`), LP value ∝ `√p`
- `cx → 1`: constant-sum (`x + y = k`), no price impact

### Health System

Health is calibrated at boundaries with 4 candidate solutions per debt mode:

```
H_XX = (vyx·CXY·pXyx + vzx·zr·pzx + rXX) / DXX
H_XY = (vxy·CXX + vzy·zr·pzx + rXY) / (DXY·pXyx)
```

The system ensures solvency within the position's range but does not dynamically adjust leverage.

## Comparison

| Aspect | Yield Basis | EulerSwap |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Leverage source | Flash loans on Curve LP tokens | Euler lending vaults |
| Leverage timing | **Dynamic** — releverage on every trade | **Static** — set once at creation |
| Target leverage | Exactly `L = 2` maintained continuously | `bXL` varies with price after creation |
| Curve shape | Curve Cryptoswap (concentrated) | Custom `fX/gY` with `cx` parameter |
| IL elimination | Yes — `(√p)² = p` | No — leverage amplifies returns but preserves `√p` shape |
| Health model | Implicit (AMM invariant ensures solvency) | Explicit `H ≥ 1` calibration at boundary |
| Rebalancing | Automatic on every swap | None — position is static |
| Oracle dependency | Yes — `pₒ` drives `x₀` recalculation | Yes — `px/py` sets equilibrium, but doesn't adjust boost |

## Why EulerSwap Cannot Directly Replicate Yield Basis

### 1. Static vs Dynamic Leverage

The fundamental gap. EulerSwap's `bXL` is computed once. As price moves away from equilibrium, the effective leverage changes — it doesn't stay at `L = 2`. Yield Basis recomputes `x₀(pₒ)` on every trade.

In concrete terms:
- **EulerSwap**: `x₀ = xr × bXC × bXL` is constant
- **Yield Basis**: `x₀(pₒ)` is a function of current oracle price, solved via quadratic on every swap

### 2. Curve Shape Doesn't Help

Increasing `cx` concentrates liquidity but doesn't change the `√p` value function — it just narrows the range. The IL per unit of price movement is the same (or worse, since concentrated positions have higher IL per dollar of price change).

### 3. Leverage Amplifies IL, Doesn't Eliminate It

EulerSwap's leverage boost multiplies virtual reserves linearly:

```
x₀ = xr × bXC × bXL
```

This increases fee capture (more virtual liquidity) but also increases IL proportionally. The value function remains `V ∝ √p`, just scaled. Yield Basis's compounding leverage changes the exponent: `V ∝ (√p)^L`.

### 4. No Releverage Mechanism

EulerSwap has no on-chain mechanism to adjust `bXL` as price moves. Adding this would require:
- Oracle-driven boost recalculation on every swap
- Flash loan or vault interaction during swaps
- New invariant accounting (tracking `(Vc)^L` vs `Vc × L`)

## What EulerSwap Can Do

While EulerSwap cannot eliminate IL, it can **mitigate** it through:

1. **High concentration + leverage**: `cx → 0.9` with `bXL > 1` gives very capital-efficient positions where fee income can outpace IL over moderate price moves
2. **Health guarantees**: Positions remain solvent within the defined range
3. **External collateral buffering**: Existing vault deposits (`rXX`, `rXY`) improve health and NAV, partially offsetting IL
4. **Narrow ranges**: Tighter `rx/ry` limits exposure to large price moves where IL is most damaging

## What Would Be Needed to Replicate

To achieve Yield Basis–style IL elimination in EulerSwap:

1. **Dynamic releverage**: Adjust `bXL` (and thus `x₀`) on every swap based on oracle price. This is a new contract-level mechanism — the current static model doesn't support it.

2. **Compounding leverage accounting**: Replace `V = xr × bXL` with `V ∝ (Vc)^L`. This changes the fundamental value function and requires new math throughout.

3. **Flash loan integration for rebalancing**: Yield Basis uses flash loans to atomically adjust leverage. Euler vaults could serve this role, but the swap-time accounting would need redesign.

4. **Fee model changes**: Yield Basis's admin fee `fa = 1 − (1−fmin)·√(1 − s/T)` is designed to extract value from arbitrageurs specifically. EulerSwap would need a similar time-dependent fee.

## Hook-Based Replication: What's Actually Possible

### EulerSwap's Hook Architecture

EulerSwap has a **three-point hook system** that fires on every swap (source: `src/interfaces/IEulerSwapHookTarget.sol`, `src/libraries/SwapLib.sol`):

```
┌─ swap() called ──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                   │
│  1. BEFORE_SWAP hook  ← can inspect amounts, sender, recipient   │
│         ↓                (reentrancy lock HELD — cannot reconfigure)

│         ↓                                                         │
│  3. Callee callback (flash-swap)                                  │
│         ↓                                                         │
│  4. Deposit input tokens                                          │
│     └─ GET_FEE hook   ← can return dynamic fee per swap           │
│         ↓                                                         │
│  5. CurveLib.verify() ← check new reserves satisfy curve invariant│
│  6. Update storage (reserve0, reserve1)                           │
│  7. Emit Swap event                                               │
│         ↓                                                         │
│  8. AFTER_SWAP hook   ← reentrancy lock RELEASED                  │
│     └─ can call reconfigure() to change ALL DynamicParams         │
│         ↓                                                         │
│  9. Re-lock reentrancy guard                                      │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### DynamicParams: What Can Be Changed

The `afterSwap` hook can call `reconfigure()` to update **every** dynamic parameter:

```solidity
struct DynamicParams {
    uint112 equilibriumReserve0;    // ← x₀ (virtual reserve)
    uint112 equilibriumReserve1;    // ← y₀ (virtual reserve)
    uint112 minReserve0;            // ← xb (boundary)
    uint112 minReserve1;            // ← yb (boundary)
    uint80  priceX;                 // ← oracle price
    uint80  priceY;
    uint64  concentrationX;         // ← cx
    uint64  concentrationY;         // ← cy
    uint64  fee0;                   // ← swap fees
    uint64  fee1;
    uint40  expiration;
    uint8   swapHookedOperations;
    address swapHook;
}
```

Plus `InitialState { reserve0, reserve1 }` — the current reserves are also passed and stored.

Authorization: `reconfigure()` checks `sender == eulerAccount || managers[sender] || sender == swapHook` (see `EulerSwapManagement.sol:160`). The `afterSwap` hook is called from the pool's own address context, so `msg.sender` is the `swapHook` address — it **is authorized** to reconfigure.

Validation: `installDynamicParams()` requires `CurveLib.verify(dParams, reserve0, reserve1)` — the new curve must still pass through (or above) the current reserve point.

### The afterSwap Hook Can Implement Releverage

The `afterSwap` hook receives complete post-swap state:

```solidity
function afterSwap(
    uint256 amount0In, uint256 amount1In,     // net input (after fees)
    uint256 amount0Out, uint256 amount1Out,    // output
    uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1,                // fees charged
    address msgSender, address to,
    uint112 reserve0, uint112 reserve1         // final reserves
) external;
```

A releverage hook could:

1. **Read current oracle price** from an external oracle (e.g., Chainlink, Euler price oracle)
2. **Compute new equilibrium reserves** `(x₀', y₀')` based on the Yield Basis formula: solve the quadratic for `x₀(pₒ)` given current debt `D` and leverage target `L = 2`
3. **Compute new boundaries** `(minReserve0', minReserve1')` from the new equilibrium
4. **Call `reconfigure()`** with the updated `DynamicParams` and current `InitialState`

The constraint is that `CurveLib.verify(newParams, currentReserve0, currentReserve1)` must pass — the current reserves must lie on or above the new curve.

### Concrete Releverage Hook Design

```solidity
contract ReleverageHook is IEulerSwapHookTarget {
    IEulerSwap public pool;
    IOracle public oracle;
    uint256 public targetLeverage;  // L = 2 for YB-style IL elimination
    uint256 public totalDebt;       // D, tracked

    function afterSwap(
        uint256 amount0In, uint256 amount1In,
        uint256 amount0Out, uint256 amount1Out,
        uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1,
        address, address,
        uint112 reserve0, uint112 reserve1
    ) external {
        // 1. Get current oracle price
        uint256 pOracle = oracle.getPrice();

        // 2. Compute new x₀ via Yield Basis quadratic (Eq. 20)
        //    x₀ = [B + √(B² + 4AC)] / (2A)
        //    where A = 1-f, B = (2L-1)D - p·y₀ - (1-f)·x₀_old, C = p·y₀·x₀_old
        uint256 newX0 = solveNewEquilibrium(pOracle, reserve0, reserve1);
        uint256 newY0 = computeY0(newX0, pOracle);

        // 3. Derive new boundaries from concentration params
        uint256 newMinReserve0 = computeMinReserve(newX0, ...);
        uint256 newMinReserve1 = computeMinReserve(newY0, ...);

        // 4. Build new params and reconfigure
        IEulerSwap.DynamicParams memory newParams = pool.getDynamicParams();
        newParams.equilibriumReserve0 = uint112(newX0);
        newParams.equilibriumReserve1 = uint112(newY0);
        newParams.minReserve0 = uint112(newMinReserve0);
        newParams.minReserve1 = uint112(newMinReserve1);
        newParams.priceX = uint80(pOracle);
        // ... update prices

        IEulerSwap.InitialState memory state = IEulerSwap.InitialState({
            reserve0: reserve0,
            reserve1: reserve1
        });

        pool.reconfigure(newParams, state);
    }
}
```

### Key Constraints and Open Questions

**What works:**
- The hook fires on every swap — same frequency as Yield Basis's per-trade releverage
- All curve-defining parameters (`x₀`, `y₀`, `xb`, `yb`, `cx`, `cy`, `px`, `py`) are mutable
- The hook has authorization to call `reconfigure()`
- Dynamic fees are also available via the `GET_FEE` hook (could implement YB's time-based fee)

**What's tricky:**

1. **Curve verification constraint**: `CurveLib.verify(newParams, reserve0, reserve1)` must hold. After a swap moves reserves away from equilibrium, the new curve must still pass through the current reserve point. This constrains how much `x₀/y₀` can shift in a single reconfiguration. Yield Basis doesn't have this constraint — its releverage happens *during* the swap via the invariant itself.

2. **Debt management**: Yield Basis's `D` (debt to the lending pool) changes as `x₀` changes. EulerSwap's debt is managed through Euler vaults (borrow/supply). The hook would need to interact with the vault system to adjust actual borrowing — but the `afterSwap` hook runs with the reentrancy lock released, so vault calls should be possible.

3. **No beforeSwap reconfigure**: The `beforeSwap` hook fires while the reentrancy lock is **held**, so it cannot call `reconfigure()`. The releverage happens *after* the swap completes, not before. This means the swap itself executes on the *old* curve, and the curve is adjusted afterward. Yield Basis adjusts *during* the swap. This ordering difference means:
   - Swapper sees the pre-releverage curve (potentially stale prices)
   - Arbitrageurs would trade against the old curve, then the hook adjusts
   - This is actually similar to how Uniswap v4 hooks work — the adjustment is retroactive

4. **Gas cost**: Each reconfiguration writes all of `DynamicParams` to storage (~13 slots). Plus oracle reads and quadratic computation. This adds meaningful gas overhead per swap.

5. **Flash loan integration**: Yield Basis uses flash loans to rebalance vault collateral during deposits/withdrawals. The `afterSwap` hook could potentially use Euler flash loans for this, but the interaction between the EulerSwap pool's own vault positions and flash loan repayment needs careful design.

6. **Compounding vs linear leverage**: The fundamental math question remains. EulerSwap's curve shape with `cx` interpolation may not produce the exact `(Vc)^L` value function that Yield Basis achieves. Even with per-swap `x₀` adjustment, the EulerSwap curve `fX(x) = y₀ + (px/py)(x₀-x)(cx + (1-cx)(x₀/x))` is not the same as Curve Cryptoswap's invariant. The IL elimination proof depends on the specific relationship between the underlying LP's value function and the leverage exponent.

### Feasibility Assessment

| Requirement | EulerSwap Hook Support | Difficulty |
|-------------|----------------------|------------|
| Per-swap releverage trigger | `afterSwap` hook fires every swap | Easy |
| Adjust virtual reserves (`x₀, y₀`) | `reconfigure()` can change `equilibriumReserve0/1` | Easy |
| Adjust boundaries | `reconfigure()` can change `minReserve0/1` | Easy |
| Dynamic fees | `getFee` hook returns per-swap fee | Easy |
| Oracle price read | Hook can call any external contract | Easy |
| Vault debt adjustment | Possible from `afterSwap` (lock released) | Medium |
| Curve verification constraint | Must ensure `verify(newParams, reserves)` | Medium |
| Correct value function `(Vc)^L` | Requires new math — EulerSwap curve ≠ Cryptoswap | Hard |
| Flash loan rebalancing | Euler flash loans available but integration complex | Hard |

## Formal Proof: IL Elimination via Compounding Leverage

**Verified numerically**: 130 tests in `src/lib/yieldbasis.test.ts`.

### Theorem 1: EulerSwap LP Value Function

For a symmetric EulerSwap pool (`cx = cy`, `px = py = p₀`, `x₀ = y₀`) with value measured in Y units:

**X side** (r ≥ 1, price rises):

```
V(r) / V(1) = √((1 − cx)(r − cx)) + cx
```

**Y side** (r < 1, price drops):

```
V(r) / V(1) = r · [√((1 − cx)(1/r − cx)) + cx]
```

where `r = p/p₀` is the price ratio.

**Derivation (X side)**:

The marginal price on the X side is:

```
P(x) = −fX'(x) = p₀ · [cx + (1−cx)·(x₀/x)²]
```

Setting `P(x) = p = r·p₀` and solving:

```
x = x₀ · √((1−cx)/(r−cx))
```

The Y reserve at this x:

```
y = fX(x) = y₀ + p₀·(x₀−x)·[cx + (1−cx)·x₀/x]
```

Total value `V = x·p + y`. After algebra:

```
V(r) = y₀ + p₀·x₀·[2√((1−cx)(r−cx)) + 2cx − 1]
```

At equilibrium (r=1), with balanced pool (`y₀ = p₀·x₀`):

```
V(1) = 2·p₀·x₀
V(r)/V(1) = √((1−cx)(r−cx)) + cx  ∎
```

**Special cases**:

| cx | V(r)/V(1) | Interpretation |
|----|-----------|----------------|
| 0 | `√r` | Standard constant-product AMM |
| → 1 | → 1 | Constant-sum (stablecoin pool, no price impact) |

### Theorem 2: cx=0, L=2 Eliminates IL

**Claim**: For EulerSwap with `cx = 0` and compounding leverage `L = 2`, impermanent loss is exactly zero for any price path.

**Proof**:

With discrete compounding at leverage `L`, after n price steps with re-centering:

```
V*_n / V*_0 = Π_{i=1}^{n} [V(r_i) / V(1)]^L
```

where `r_i = p_i / p_{i-1}` (per-step price ratio after re-centering).

For `cx = 0`: `V(r)/V(1) = √r` (both sides — the Y-side formula `r·√(1/r) = √r` agrees).

At `L = 2`:

```
Π [√r_i]^2 = Π r_i = (p_1/p_0)·(p_2/p_1)·...·(p_n/p_{n-1}) = p_n/p_0
```

The product telescopes. The HODL return for the X asset is also `p_n/p_0`.

Therefore `V*/HODL = 1`, and **IL = 0**. ∎

**Key insight**: This works because `√r` is a power function (`r^{1/2}`), and `[r^{1/2}]^2 = r` for all `r`. The telescoping is exact regardless of path, volatility, or number of steps.

### Theorem 3: cx > 0, No Constant L Eliminates IL

**Claim**: For EulerSwap with `cx > 0`, no constant leverage `L` can eliminate impermanent loss for all price ratios.

**Proof**:

IL elimination requires `[V(r)/V(1)]^L = r` for all `r > 0`.

At `L = 2`:

```
[√((1−cx)(r−cx)) + cx]² = r
```

Expanding:

```
(1−cx)(r−cx) + 2cx·√((1−cx)(r−cx)) + cx² = r
```

Rearranging (for `cx ≠ 0`):

```
2√((1−cx)(r−cx)) = 1 + r − 2cx
```

Squaring:

```
4(1−cx)(r−cx) = (1 + r − 2cx)²
4r − 4cx − 4cx·r + 4cx² = 1 + r² + 4cx² + 2r − 4cx − 4cx·r
4r = 1 + r² + 2r
0 = (r − 1)²
```

This holds **only at r = 1**. For any `r ≠ 1`, the equation fails. ∎

**Corollary**: The value function `√((1−cx)(r−cx)) + cx` is not a power of `r` when `cx > 0`. The "implied exponent" `α(r) = log(V(r)/V(1)) / log(r)` varies with `r`, so no constant `L = 1/α` works for all prices.

### Theorem 4: Residual IL Quantification (cx > 0)

For small price changes `r = 1 + ε`:

```
[V(1+ε)/V(1)]² ≈ (1 + ε) − cx·ε²/(4(1−cx))
```

The residual IL per step is:

```
ΔIL ≈ −cx·ε²/(4(1−cx))
```

This is always negative (loss), scales with `cx/(1−cx)`, and is `O(ε²)` — small for small price moves but accumulates over many steps.

### Practical Implications

#### cx=0 does not mean low capital efficiency

Capital efficiency in EulerSwap comes from **two independent sources**:

1. **Concentration parameter `cx`**: Interpolates curve shape between constant-product (cx=0) and constant-sum (cx→1)
2. **Price range `rx`, `ry`**: Controls how far from equilibrium the pool operates. Narrower range = higher concentration boost `bXC = sX/(sX−1)` where `sX = √(1+rx)` (at cx=0)

With cx=0, the price range alone provides excellent capital efficiency:

| rx | Price range (Y/X) | bXC boost | With L=2 |
|----|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| 0.01 | 0.99 – 1.01 | 201x | 403x |
| 0.05 | 0.95 – 1.05 | 41x | 83x |
| 0.10 | 0.91 – 1.10 | 21x | 43x |
| 0.20 | 0.83 – 1.20 | 11x | 23x |
| 0.50 | 0.67 – 1.50 | 5.4x | 11x |
| 1.00 | 0.50 – 2.00 | 3.4x | 6.8x |

A 10% range (rx=0.1) at cx=0 gives **21x** concentration boost from range alone, and **43x** with L=2 leverage. This is comparable to Uniswap v3 concentrated positions.

The key advantage of the releverage hook: **the range re-centers after every swap**, so the window always tracks the current price. A narrow range doesn't mean the pool stops working outside it — the hook moves the range to wherever the price is.

#### Strategy matrix

| Parameter | IL Behavior | Capital Efficiency |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| `cx = 0, L = 2` | **Exact elimination** | Set by `rx/ry` — narrow range = high efficiency |
| `cx > 0, L = 2` | Residual ∝ `cx·ε²/(1−cx)` | Higher from cx, but IL not eliminated |
| `cx = 0, L = 1` | Standard AMM IL (`√r − 1`) | Range-only concentration |
| `cx = 0, L = 3` | Over-leveraged | Higher virtual liquidity, but magnified downside |

The optimal configuration for a hook-based IL-elimination strategy:
- **cx = 0** for exact IL elimination (Theorem 2)
- **rx = ry = small** (e.g. 0.05–0.2) for high capital efficiency via price range concentration
- **L = 2** is the unique leverage that eliminates IL
- **afterSwap hook re-centers** on every swap, so narrow range is not limiting

## Conclusion

The formal proof resolves the open question from the hook analysis:

1. **cx = 0 with L = 2**: EulerSwap **can** exactly replicate Yield Basis–style IL elimination. The `afterSwap` hook re-centers the curve after each swap, maintaining L=2 compounding leverage. The mathematical proof shows IL = 0 for any price path (Theorem 2). Capital efficiency is not sacrificed — a narrow price range (small `rx`) provides concentration independent of `cx`.

2. **cx > 0**: No constant leverage eliminates IL (Theorem 3). The residual IL is `O(cx·ε²/(1−cx))` per step (Theorem 4). Since cx=0 already achieves both IL elimination and high capital efficiency via range concentration, there is no reason to use cx>0 for this strategy.

3. **Mechanism**: The `afterSwap` hook + `reconfigure()` provides the per-swap rebalancing infrastructure. The main engineering challenges are vault debt management (borrowing/repaying to maintain L=2) and the `CurveLib.verify` constraint (new curve must pass through current reserves).
